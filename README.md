The homepage for a 24 hour held at semi-annually at SUNY Potsdam &amp; Clarkson University.

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/PotsdamACM/hackpotsdam.git`
2. Done!

## Developing Using Source Files (optional, you don't have to do this)

To use the source files, you will need to have npm installed globally along with Gulp.js. To start:
* Run `npm install` in the root directory
* Run `gulp dev` and edit the files as needed

If you need to update the plugins included with this template, simply run the following tasks:
* First run `npm update` to update the dependencies
* Then run `gulp copy` to copy the new versions to their proper destinations
